# -Drawing-Class-Diagram-for-Data-Optimization

This project involves developing a class diagram for an online bookstore system, "Real Books," which allows customers to browse, purchase, and track books. The system also enables stock management by store personnel. The project consists of several Python classes representing the primary entities in the system, each with attributes and methods to handle various functionalities, such as searching for books, managing carts, processing payments, and tracking orders.

Project Structure

Classes:

Customer: Handles user account details, book searching, adding books to the cart, placing orders, and tracking orders.

Book: Manages book details, stock updates, and discount applications.

Cart: Represents the customerâ€™s cart with items, including methods for adding, removing, and calculating the total price.

Order: Contains order information, including tracking status and cancellation options.

Payment: Processes and manages payment details for orders.

StockManager: Monitors and updates stock quantities for the bookstore.

Access Modifiers

Private attributes (-): Used to protect sensitive data, e.g., -password in Customer.

Public methods (+): Provided for functions like processPayment() in Payment for authorized interactions.

Diagram Benefits

Enhanced System Overview: Visualizes relationships and data flow.

Data Security: Encapsulation through access modifiers clarifies data accessibility.

Limitations

Static View: Lacks dynamic system behavior.

Scalability: Can become complex with larger systems.
